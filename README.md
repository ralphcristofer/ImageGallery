Simple Gallery using Fetch API.

The page will display pictures that are specified in the JSON provided by the API.
The JSON is loaded from the response of the API address above when the page is loaded.

The Gallery rotates automatically based on the attribute time provided in the JSON file.
There is also a manual button to show pictures (Next/Previous).
